												I grew up right around the corner in the Montgomery County and attended <a href = "https://www.udsd.org/schools/udhs/">Upper Dublin High school</a> (class of 2007).  I then did my undergraduate degree in <a href = "https://ee.princeton.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a> at Princeton University and my master's and Ph.D. degrees in <a href = "https://ece.duke.edu/">Electrical And Computer Engineering</a> at Duke University (heavily studying math and CS along the way).  I finally started my dream job at Ursinus College in Fall of 2019!  You can read more about my interests on my <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com/">professional web site</a>.  Looking forward to getting to know everyone as we work through this course together!

											<h3>Course Description</h3>
												
												<p>
													This capstone course will give students a broad overview of both AI and machine learning at an undergraduate level, and it will act as a primer for future graduate work or industry work in these areas.  This is a daunting task, as we are currently in an "<a href = "https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/talks/Kautz%20Engelmore%20Lecture%20Directors%20Cut.pdf">AI summer</a>," where progress is moving extremely rapidly.  As such, we will strive to strike a balance between surveying important modern developments, while also developing a strong classical foundation and conceptual framework for modeling and solving problems.  We will take tools from algorithms and data structures, statistics, and numerical math to build strategies for knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, state space search, and supervised, unsupservised, and representation learning.  Armed with these tools, we will examine applications in game playing, natural language processing, image processing, computer vision, and digital audio.  We will be ever mindful of the ethical implications of AI/ML as we build this knowledge, and five classes will be devoted to studying ethical issues, primarily via the text <a href = "#readings">Race After Technology</a>.  Finally, the course will culminate in an open ended project in which students apply the technique we develop to model and solve a problem of their own choosing.

												<a name = "sensitive">*</a>: For <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act">privacy reasons</a>, anything of a personal nature, and particularly things that have to with educational records (e.g. grades), need to be kept within Ursinus sanctioned platforms like Outlook e-mail and Microsoft Teams.
											</p>
	
											<h3>Canvas</h3>
											<p>
												We will be using Canvas, but only to submit assignments and to store all of the grades.  I will also keep all of the due dates current on the calendar there, as students have appreciated this common space for all of their classes in the past.
											</p>

	
											<h3><a name = "discord">Discord</a></h3>
											<p>
												To facilitate informal, class-wide discussions about the class, we will have a Discord channel for the class.  My goal is for this to turn into a flourishing area to work through <a href = "#confusion">confusion</a> and to share ideas as a group.  All questions are welcome! <b>We will also keep the CS 477 Discord channel open during class for polling and for general questions for students who are shy about speaking up verbally in front of their peers.</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												In addition to the regular channel, we will be holding drop-in student office hours on the Ursinus ACM Discord channel, since student office hours are joint between my classes.  You can find it under the "Chit Chat" Category, as shown below
											</p>
											<p>
												<img src = "OfficeHours.png">
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>I will be on that channel even for the office hours that are held in person</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												Please <b>do not</b> send me direct messages or anything of a sensitive nature (e.g. grades) over Discord.  Instead, use <a href = "#teams">Microsoft Teams</a> or e-mail for that, since those transactions are locked down better under Ursinus control.
											</p>

											
	
	
											<h3><a name = "teams">Microsoft Teams</a></h3>
											<p>
												For one on one direct messages with me, and for <a href = "#buddy">buddy group coding</a> with screen sharing, we will be using  <a href = "https://insights.ursinus.edu/display/LEI/Microsoft+Teams">Microsoft Teams</a>, which is linked to your Office suite through Ursinus, so you are automatically enrolled.  This is an easy platform for students to initiate video sharing, so I highly recommend it for group work.
											</p>

											
											<hr>
											<h2><a name = "readings">Readings</a></h2>
											<p>
												There is no official textbook for the technical part of the course.  Readings from a variety of sources will be linked on the <a href = "#schedule">schedule</a>.  Videos that go over the topics will be provided for students who have to miss class.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the ethics part of the course, we will be using the following book, which we will discuss throughout four class sessions spread out during the semester.

											<h3><a name = "programming">Programming Assignments</a></h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                Since the goal is to give you a broad, hands-on overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing a number of medium scale programming assignments throughout the course.  Be sure to start them early, since debug time can often be unpredictable!  Please refer to the <a href = "#collaboration">collaboration and sharing rules</a> for these assignments.
											</p>

											<h4>A word on patience and <a name = "debugging">debugging</a></h3>
											<p>
												If you're taking this course, then you've certainly had experience with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a>, but it is a skill you will still need to work on, so you should expect to hit some roadblocks.  In fact, it is time consuming and difficult even for very experienced programmers.  So do not be hard on yourself if your programs don't work the first time around (they rarely do, even if you've been programming for decades!).  But be sure you leave yourself adequate time to work on the assignments, because the amount of time it takes to resolve issues can be unpredictable.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "preclass">Class Engagement / Pre-Class Work</a></h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
												It's easier to learn a difficult subject like AI by going through a number of examples on each topic beyond the examples in the large assignments.  Because of this, we will often do small programming exercises and experiments in class related to a topic that we're learning.  At times, I may ask you to read over a description of an exercise or to read some notes about a new topic before class so we can go more deeply into the examples.  I may also ask you to hand in something small related to the class exercises to make sure you were putting effort in during class.  This will all make up a small part of your <a href = "#grading">grade</a> in the class.
											</p>

											<p>
												Beyond that, we will have 5 classes devoted to ethics discussions.  I will ask you to watch a video or to do some readings before class, and to answer a few brief reflection questions to make sure you are prepared to have a meaningful discussion.  I will also grade for participation during these classes.

											<h2><a name = "environment">Classroom Environment</a></h2>

											<h3><a name = "inclusive">Inclusive Environment</a></h3>

											<p>
												Computer science is a field that has <a href = "https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality">historically been and continues to be</a> steeped in inequalities.  As we will see, modern AI and machine learning techniques have <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbcG7e2dBj0">added fuel to the fire</a>, so there is a special role and responsibility that those who have AI/ML knowledge have to play in being good stewards around both the technology and within work environments.
											
											</p>
											<p>
												Within class interactions, my goal is to foster a environment in which students across all axes of diversity feel <b>welcome and valued, both by me and by their peers</b>.  Axes of diversity include, but are not limited to, age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity/gender expression (please feel free to tell me in person or over e-mail which pronouns I should use), national origin, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation.  Discrimination of any form will not be tolerated.
											</p>

											<p>
												A slightly more subtle thing that we want to watch out for in class is not to assume anything about others based on implicit biases.  <b>I have heard from quieter students at Ursinus from different backgrounds in the past that they sometimes feel their contributions aren't valued from their group members and that they're talked over during collaborations</b>.  So please be mindful of this and be sure to curb this behavior in yourself if you notice it...this is something immediate you can to do help stem the <a href = "https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/fixing-leaky-pipeline">leaky pipeline in our field</a>.
											</p>

											<p>
												<a name = "confusion">.</a>Furthermore, I want all students to feel <b>comfortable expressing their opinions or confusion</b> at any point in the course, as long as they do so respectfully.  As I will stress over and over, being confused is an important part of the process of learning computer science.  Learning computer science and struggling to grow is <a href = "https://i0.wp.com/katielmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1_9HzbByi2Uzit8474Rp4ZPg-1.jpg?w=550&ssl=1">not always comfortable</a>, but I want it to feel safe.  In other words, I will regularly keep you at the boundary of your comfort zone with challenging, real-world assignments, but I want you to feel comfortable with me and your peers and respected as a learner during the process<a name = "communication">.</a>
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, I am aware that, particularly during the pandemic, there are a variety of factors that may make it difficult to perform at your best level in class.  At Ursinus, we are fortunate to have quite a mix of students from different backgrounds, many of whom need to work part time, and an increasing number of whom are commuters and have family obligations.  If you find yourself having difficulty performing at the level that you want and/or turning assignments in on time because of any of these issues, <b>please communicate with me</b>, and we can come up with a solution together (I will gently reach out if I notice any slips even if you don't communicate).  This is an exciting capstone course, and I want to work to keep your excitement alive, regardless of your personal circumstances.  We will get you through the course as long as the lines of communication are open and we work together.  <u><b>You belong in CS!</b></u>
											</p>

											<h3>Classroom Attendance And Etiquette</h3>

											<p>
												Students are expected to attend class in person.  We're shooting for <b>engagement</b> over mere attendance; students are expected to be active in class exercises and to be fully invested in the class (i.e. no internet browsing).  Students who are unable to attend class for significant reasons (whether isolation or quarantine for students who have received a positive test, those experiencing Covid-related symptoms while awaiting test results, or other issues that make it difficult to attend class) should work pro-actively to make up any <a href = "#preclass">class exercises</a> that they missed.  To help with this, I will do my best to put up Youtube videos from other instructors on topics that we cover.
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, students are expected to follow any college policy requiring mask wearing on campus, in addition to following any guidance faculty provide for their individual classes.Masks should be available in every academic building, if needed.
											</p>



											<h3>Maximizing Your Communal Experience</h3>
											<p>
												Here are ways students can maximize their experience as a class community, and which <b>could lead to extra credit in certain situations</b>.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Helping to teach a student a topic during student office hours.</li>
												<li>Certain calls for participation in class</li>
												<li>Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Discord</li>
												<li>Finding mistakes in the book or on the assigned homework </li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Discord Communication Policy</h3>
											Since this is a class-wide communication, the following rules apply to online communication
											<ul>
												<li>
													Students are expected to be respectful and mindful of the <a href = "#environment">classroom environment and inclusivity standards</a>.  They are equally applicable to a virtual environment as they are in class.</li>

												<li>
													Students <b>are not</b> permitted to publicly share direct answers or questions which might completely give away answers to any homework problems.  When in doubt, please send me a direct message.
												</li>

												<li>
													I will attempt to answer questions real time during my <a href = "#virtual">virtual student office hours</a>.  Otherwise, I will make every attempt to respond within 24 hours on weekdays.  <i>I cannot be expected to respond at all on Saturdays or Sundays or outside of 10AM-8PM on weekdays</i>, so please plan accordingly.  (Of course, students can and should still respond to each other outside of these intervals, when appropriate).
                                                </li>
											</ul>

											<p>
											The points above are part of a more general term referred to as "<b>netiquette</b>."  Please refer to the chart below, provided by <a href = "http://blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu/15-rules-netiquette-online-discussion-boards/">Touro College</a>

											<h2><a name = "collaboration">Collaboration Policy</a></h2>

											<h3>Overall Philosophy</h3>
											<p>
											    The collaboration policy for this class walks the line between encouraging openness and collaboration during a challenging learning process, while also making sure that each students is progressing technically at an individual level without relying on 100% on other classmates.  Communication between students is allowed (and encouraged!) on most assignments, but it is expected that every student's code or writeups will be completely distinct.  Please do not copy code off of the Internet.  Please cite any sources in addition to materials linked from the course website that you used to help in crafting your code and completing the assignment.
                                            </p>
											
											<h3><a name = "buddy">Assignment Buddies</a></h3>
                                            <p>
                                                To encourage collaboration, students will be allowed (not required) to choose one or more "<b>buddies</b>" to work "near" during the programming assignments.  Students are still expected to submit their own solutions, but they are allowed to provide substantial help to each other, and even to look at each others' code during the process.  <b>Students should indicate their buddies in the README upon assignment submission.</b>  Please let me know if you would like a buddy but are having trouble finding one.
											</p>
											

											<h3>Collaboration Scenarios Table</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Below is a table spelling out in more detail when and how you are allowed to share code with people (table style cribbed from <a href = "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos126/syllabus.html">Princeton CS 126</a>).  </p>

I am required to make this report in every occurrence, so it is best to speak with me first if there are any questions about the policy or expectations. You should feel free to have these conversations with me anytime prior to making your submission without fear of penalty.

											<p>
												On a more personal note, though a willful violation of academic honesty may seem merely transactional to a student, faculty take violations very personally, as they are disrespectful to the time and effort we put into our courses.  I would also like to emphasize that <b>your reputation is much more important than your grades</b>.  The recommendations we as faculty write go a long way, and we are much happier to write positive recommendations for students with lower grades who show grit and growth than we are to write recommendations for students with higher grades who have cheated.

										<HR>
											<h2><a name = "other">Other Resources / Policies</a></h2>

											<h3><a name = "accommodations">Accommodations</a></h3>

											<p>
												In addition to our general awareness diversity, Ursinus College is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.  Students with a disability should contact the Directory of Disability Services ASAP.  Dolly Singley is located in the Center for Academic Support in the lower level of Myrin Library.  Please visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/students-with-disabilities/current-students-/">this link</a> for more information on the process.  I will do my best to accommodate your requests, and they will be kept completely confidential.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "tutoring">One on One Tutoring</a></h3>
											<p>
												One on one tutoring for up to two hours per week is available through the institute for student success.  Please <a href = "https://ursinus.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MD0p25wtqMFL25">click here</a> to fill out a Qualtrics survey if you'd like to take advantage of this.
											</p>

											<h3>Let's Talk</h3>
											<p>
												Mental health care is increasingly recognized as a crucial service for the undergraduate population.  Please visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/wellness-center/">this link</a> for more information about complementary counseling services provided by the college.  The Wellness Center has a virtual drop-in crisis hour at 2-3 pm each weekday, which is available for students in crisis who need to be seen immediately by a clinician.  If you are still hesitant to go, take me (Professor Tralie) as an example of someone who has benefited greatly from talk therapy and medication in the past.  I am happy to discuss this in student office hours in more detail.
											</p>

											<h3>Title IX</h3>
											<p>
												Title IX is a federal law, under which it is prohibited to discriminate on the basis of gender. The <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/prevention-and-advocacy/title-ix/">Title IX Coordinator</a> is available to receive inquiries and to investigate allegations in this regard. 
											</p>

											<h3>Inclement Weather Policy (aka COVID Policy)</h3>
											<p>
												In the event that the College closes due to inclement weather or other circumstances (such as a COVID lockdown), our in-person class sessions, drop-in student office hours, or other meetings will not be held. I will contact you regarding our plan with regard to rescheduling the class or the material, any assignments that are outstanding, and how we can move forward with the material (for example, any readings or remote discussions that we can apply). If necessary, I may schedule online virtual sessions in lieu of class sessions, and will contact you with information about how to participate in those. I will communicate this plan to the department so that it can be posted on my office door if it is feasible to do so. This policy and procedure will also apply in the event that the College remains open but travel conditions are hazardous or not otherwise conducive to holding class as normal. Should another exigent circumstance arise (for example, illness), I will follow this policy and procedure as well.
